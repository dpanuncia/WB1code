<h1>This what Cubas Climate looks like</h1>
<p>Cuba has a tropical climate and only two seasons: wet and dry. The wet season lasts from May to November, while the dry season lasts from December to April. The weather can, however, vary depending on what region you're in. Aside from Cuba's more mountainous destinations, much of the island is hot and humid.</p>
